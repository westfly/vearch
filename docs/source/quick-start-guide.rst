--------

Environmental dependence

1. Linux system(recommend CentOS 7.2 or more), supporting cmake and make commands.
2. Go version 1.11.2 or more
3. Gcc version 5 or more
4. `Faiss <https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss>`_

Compile

-  download source code: git clone https://github.com/vearch/vearch.git (Follow-up use of $vearch to represent the absolute path of the vearch directory)

-  compile gamma

   1. ``cd $vearch/engine/gamma/src``
   2. ``mkdir build && cd build``
   3. ``export Faiss_HOME=faiss安装路径``
   4. ``cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib ..``
   5. ``make && make install``

-  compile vearch

   1. ``cd $vearch``
   2. ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib/lib``
   3. ``export Faiss_HOME=faiss installed path``
   4. ``go build -a --tags=vector -o  vearch``
   
   generate \ ``vearch``\ file compile success

Deploy
--------
