# Vearch Compile and Deploy

## Docker Deploy

#### Docker Hub Image Center 
 1. vearch base compile environment image address: https://hub.docker.com/r/vearch/vearch/tags
 2. vearch deploy image address: https://hub.docker.com/r/vearch/vearch/tags

#### Use Vearch Image Deploy
 1. take vearch:3.1.0 as an example
 2. docker pull vearch/vearch:0.3.1
 3. one docker deploy or distributed deployment
    1. ```If deploy a docker start vearch,master,ps,router start together: cat vearch/config/config.toml.example > config.toml nohup docker run -p 8817:8817 -p 9001:9001 -v $PWD/config.toml:/vearch/config.toml  vearch/vearch:0.3.1 all &```
  
    2. ```If distributed deploy ,modify vearch/config/config.toml and start separately```
    3. ```Modify vearch/config/config.toml ,refer the step 'Local Model'```
    4. ```Start separately image, modify step i 'all' to 'master' and 'ps' and 'router' ,master image must first start```

#### Use Base Image Compile And Deploy
 1. take vearch_env:3.1.0 as an example
 2. docker pull vearch/vearch_env:0.3.1
 3. sh vearch/cloud/complile.sh
 4. sh build.sh
 5. reference "User vearch image deploy" step 3

#### Use Script Create Base Image And Vearch Image
 1. build compile base environment image 
    1. go to $vearch/cloud dir
    2. run ./compile_env.sh you will got a image named vearch_env
 2. compile vearch
    1. go to $vearch/cloud dir
    2. run ./compile.sh you will compile Vearch in $vearch/build/bin , $vearch/build/lib
 3. make vearch image
    1. go to $vearch/cloud dir
    2. run ./build.sh you will got a image named vearch good luck
 4. how to use it 
    1. you can use docker run -it -v config.toml:/vearch/config.toml vearch all to start vearch by local model the last param has four type[ps, router ,master, all] all means tree type to start
 5. One-click build vearch image
    1. go to $vearch/cloud dir
    2. you can run ./run_docker.sh

## No Image Compile And Deploy

#### Dependent Environment 

   1. CentOS, Ubuntu and Mac OS are all OK (recommend CentOS >= 7.2)ï¼Œcmake required
   2. Go >= 1.11.2 required
   3. Gcc >= 5 required
   4. [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) >= v1.6.0
   5. [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) == 6.2.2 ***(optional)***. Please use `make shared_lib` which is in `RocksDB's INSTALL.md` to compile rocksdb. When you want to use rocksdb to store vectors or you want to make the data persistent, you need to install rocksdb. If rocksdb is not installed, then the data will be lost if you restart, you need to re-insert the data.
   6. CUDA >= 9.0, if you want GPU support.
#### Compile 
   * Enter the `GOPATH` directory, `cd $GOPATH/src` `mkdir -p github.com/vearch` `cd github.com/vearch`
   * Download the source code: `git clone https://xxxxxx/vearch.git` ($vearch denotes the absolute path of vearch code)
   * To add GPU Index support : change `BUILD_WITH_GPU` from `"off"` to `"on"` in `$vearch/engine/CMakeLists.txt` 
   * Compile gamma
       1. `cd $vearch/engine`
       2. `mkdir build && cd build`
       3. `export FAISS_HOME=the installed path of faiss`
       4. `export ROCKSDB_HOME=the directory where you compiled(make shared_lib) rocksdb`
       5. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib  ..`
       6. `make && make install`
   
   * Compile vearch
      1. `cd $vearch`
      2. `export FAISS_HOME=the installed path of faiss`
      3. `export ROCKSDB_HOME=the directory where you compiled(make shared_lib) rocksdb`
      4. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib/lib:$FAISS_HOME/lib` or `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib/lib:$FAISS_HOME/lib:$ROCKSDB_HOME` if ROCKSDB_HOME is set
      5. `go build -o vearch`
      when `vearch` file generated, it is ok.
           
       
#### Deploy
   Before run vearch, you shuld set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, Ensure that system can find faiss and gamma dynamic libraries (like $vearch/ps/engine/gammacb/lib/lib and $FAISS_HOME/lib directory files) .
